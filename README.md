## Perceptron Neural Network Implementation
This project is a neural network implementation using the perceptron algorithm. It includes a GUI built with Tkinter for parameter input and visualization of training and testing results. The project allows users to train the perceptron model on different datasets and evaluate its performance.

### Features
* Interactive GUI:
  * Input parameters such as Epoch and Learning Rate.
  * Select the dataset file through a file picker.
  * Visualize the training and testing results in real-time.
* Training and Testing Workflow:
  * Automatically splits the dataset into training (2/3) and testing (1/3) subsets.
  * Visualizes the classification boundary and outputs:
    * Training Accuracy
    * Testing Accuracy
* Supports Multiple Datasets:
The project supports various datasets for evaluating the model.
